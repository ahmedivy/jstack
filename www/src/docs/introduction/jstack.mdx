# About JStack

**JStack is a TypeScript + Next.js stack built for maximum developer experience and application performance.** It builds on some of the most modern, high-quality pieces of software in 2025:

- [**Hono ðŸ”¥**](https://hono.dev/) as a portable, lightweight Next.js backend
- [**Zod ðŸ’Ž**](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for runtime validation
- [**Drizzle ORM ðŸŽ­**](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to interact with our database

In the following section, I'll explain why these tools provide an incredible foundation for building fast, reliable, and production-ready Next.js applications.

## Why I created JStack

Since I first tried the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) a few years ago, I've loved the concept of type safety between client and server.

Using TypeScript across the front- and backend gives you crazy confidence when writing code and prevents bugs before they happen. 

Combine that with the runtime safety provided by [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), and you've got a safe and TypeScript-friendly way to build full-stack Next.js projects.

However, over a few years of using the T3 stack for YouTube projects (both privately and for my production Next.js projects), **I wish the stack did a few things differently**.

### 1. Independent State Management

tRPC is a _fantastic_ tool for providing type-safety between your frontend and backend. However, it has the trade-off of coupling itself to React Query hooks. This coupling is convenient but also limiting. As you get into more advanced use cases and eventually run into problems, I find myself having to find the "tRPC-specific" solution to the problem.

Almost every question about React Query, every pattern you might want to know about, has already been answered. Often even by the (very active) maintainer [TKDodo himself](https://x.com/TkDodo):

The user base is so large that there are almost no unanswered questions. Best practices have been established over the years, and the tRPC implementation sometimes interferes with them.

I also find myself unable to use React Query as an **incredible** standalone state manager because tRPC associates a frontend declaration with a backend procedure.

JStack does not couple its type-safe client to any state manager. It works perfectly with React Query and any other state manager you might want to use (like Zustand, Jotai, and even Redux ðŸ¤®). Calling your client directly from a Zustand store outside of React scope? No problem, because your client is just a type-safe fetch wrapper.

You can use all the standard React Query best practices and patterns and don't need to find tRPC-specific solutions to your problems. I like this no abstraction approach a lot more.

### 2. Not Just JSON Responses

Because I built JStack on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev), which uses web standard responses under the hood, your API is not limited to JSON responses. JStack natively supports:

- JSON
- SuperJSON
- Plain text
- HTML
- Web Standard Response

I've never felt comfortable building anything other than app-internal APIs in tRPC. JStack routers follow an intuitive naming convention to serve both internal APIs and anything public-facing, all right from a single Next.js backend.

### 3. Platform Agnostic Deployment

I recommend deploying to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) because they are incredibly cheap, fast, and natively support long-lived WebSocket connections. However, JStack is built on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev), so you can deploy anywhere with minimal to no code changes:

- Cloudflare
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Railway
- AWS
- ...
